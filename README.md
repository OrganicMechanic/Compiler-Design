# Compiler-Design
My work for the Compiler Design class at the University of Idaho.

To any students who are taking the class and would like to use my work, go for it. Just know a few things:

1. A ton of my work was based off of the work of other people, and I credited them as such. Dr. J didn't have an issue with it, but credit MUST be given to avoid plagerism. I included the names of the people who's work I used as a base for my own in the header comments of each file.

2. I did pass the class, BY THE SKIN OF MY TEETH. My work was solid all the way up through around assignment 3/4, which is where things get hairy. I went through a metric ton of scope revisions, and rebased my code several times. If things get incoherent at that point, know that's why. I spent many hours figuring out which questions to ask, and sent many emails to Dr. J trying to figure out what to do, and I recommend you do the same. Without his help, I'd have been stuck there. Know that following this code all the way through won't net you an "A."

3. I completed the class in 2018, so my requirements might not match up with the new ones. Keep that in mind when borrowing/using this.
